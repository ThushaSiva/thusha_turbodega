        <h3>As a member of Turbodega, distributors will be first asked to fill up their catalogue page with items they provide to filter the bids they have access to on their bidding page. This allows them to only receive active bids based on their inventory. In addition, all their past bids can be viewed on the bidding history page.</h3>
